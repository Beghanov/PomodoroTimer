# Pomodoro Timer Project

## Description

This project is a simple Pomodoro Timer that allows you to select a custom timer duration (e.g., 10, 20, 25, 30 minutes) and tracks your productivity intervals. When the timer ends, it triggers a visual effect and alerts you that the time is up, signaling that it's time to take a break.

## Components

- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for timer functionality and interactions

## Features

- Select a custom timer duration (10, 20, 25, or 30 minutes)
- Timer countdown with visual updates
- Background color change when the timer finishes
- Alert message after timer ends
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Setup Instructions

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. The timer will start when you click the "Start" button, and you can reset it by clicking the "Reset" button.

## How It Works

- The user selects the desired time duration from a dropdown menu.
- The timer starts counting down once the "Start" button is clicked.
- When the timer reaches zero, the background color changes to green, signaling the end of the session.
- An alert message pops up to notify the user that it's time to take a break.

## Code Walkthrough

The core functionality of the Pomodoro timer is implemented in JavaScript. Here’s a brief explanation of how the code works:

1. The `startTimer()` function:
   - Starts the countdown when the "Start" button is clicked.
   - Updates the timer every second and displays the time remaining on the page.

2. The `resetTimer()` function:
   - Resets the timer to the selected time duration and stops any running intervals.
   - Resets the background color to its original state.

3. The `triggerEndEffect()` function:
   - Changes the background color to green when the timer finishes.
   - Displays an alert that it’s time for a break.
